Code documentation:
- Data set: Post-hurricane.zip
- Code: 
    (1) EDA
    (2) Models
    (3) Eval 

    (1) EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis will help us understand the dataset better. 
    (2) Models - Used to train multiple different models to train on the dataset to find out which model performs the best.
    (3) Eval - To test results by loading the best performing model from Models.

- Model Weights: saved_models
    Model weights can be found in saved_models which can then be loaded into the Eval notebook to be able to see the performance of that model. 

- Graphs includes all the plots of accuracy and loss for each of the models trained.
